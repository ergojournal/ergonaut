Dear <%= @recipients_list %>,

Thank you for agreeing to review "<%= @submission.title %>" for Ergo. You can complete your report here:

    <%= one_click_review_url(@referee_assignment.auth_token) %>

The report is due <%= @referee_assignment.date_due_pretty %>.

Ergo review policy currently allows only Reject, Accept, and Minor Revisions verdicts - there is no Major Revisions option. Please bear this in mind when composing reports.

<% if @submission.revision_number > 0 %>
Since this is a resubmission, the only decisions available to the editors at this stage are <%= Decision::ACCEPT %> and <%= Decision::REJECT %>. The author(s) can be encouraged to make changes if the submission is accepted, but revisions cannot be made a precondition of acceptance.
