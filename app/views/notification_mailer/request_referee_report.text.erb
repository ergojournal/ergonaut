If you know the identity of the author, please decline *without explanation*. In particular, please do not say that you know the identity of the author, as this may reveal it to the editor sending this request. Ergo uses triple-anonymous review, so it's even possible that you are the author, unbeknownst to the editor. Again, if this is the case, *please do not say so*. Simply decline without explanation and without suggesting alternative reviewers.
