		<h1>About Ergo</h1>
		<br/>

		<p><em>Ergo</em> is an open access philosophy journal which publishes research on all philosophical topics and from all philosophical traditions. 
		This includes, among other things, history of philosophy, work in both the analytic and continental traditions, and formal and empirically informed philosophy. 
		<em>Ergo</em> is strongly committed to diversity and especially welcomes submissions from members of groups currently underrepresented in philosophy.</p>
		<p>Publication of accepted articles is free. Authors retain copyright under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0</a> license. 
		As of August 2020, we have implemented a standard submission fee of $20.
		Due to the costs of copy-editing, type-setting and journal hosting, Ergo cannot continue operations without revenue derived from this fee.
		Waivers for financial hardship and for members of subscribing departments are available, and there is no fee for resubmissions.</p>
		<p>We acknowledge financial support from the <a href="https://thecollege.syr.edu/philosophy/">Department of Philosophy</a>, <a href="https://thecollege.syr.edu/">College of Arts and Sciences</a>, and <a href="https://library.syr.edu/">Library</a> at Syracuse University. 
		Previous financial support was provided by the University of Toronto's <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/st-george/">St. George</a> and <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/utm/">Mississauga</a> campuses, as well as the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/st-george/graduate/">graduate department of philosophy</a>.
		You can contribute towards Ergo by asking your department to subscribe to our <%= link_to "institutional submission fee waiver scheme", subscribe_path %>, or by making a <%= link_to "donation", subscribe_path %>.</p>
		<p>Papers are <a href="http://www.ergophiljournal.org">published</a> as they are accepted; there is no regular publication schedule.</p>
