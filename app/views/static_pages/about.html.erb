		<h1>About Ergo</h1>
		<br/>

		<p><em>Ergo</em> is an open access philosophy journal which publishes research on all philosophical topics and from all philosophical traditions. This includes, among other things, history of philosophy, work in both the analytic and continental traditions, as well as formal and empirically informed philosophy. <em>Ergo</em> is strongly committed to diversity and especially welcomes submissions from members of groups currently underrepresented in philosophy.</p>
